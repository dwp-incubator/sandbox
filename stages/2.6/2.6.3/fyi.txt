# curl and POST redirections

Extract from `man curl` on the behaviour of redirect, never knew!!

-L, --location
              (HTTP/HTTPS) If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response code), this  option  will  make  curl
              redo  the  request on the new place. If used together with -i, --include or -I, --head, headers from all requested pages will be shown. When authentication is used, curl only sends its
              credentials to the initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different host, it won't be able to intercept the user+password. See also --location-trusted on how to change  this.  You
              can limit the amount of redirects to follow by using the --max-redirs option.

              When curl follows a redirect and the request is not a plain GET (for example POST or PUT), it will do the following request with a GET if the HTTP response was 301, 302, or 303. If the
              response code was any other 3xx code, curl will re-send the following request using the same unmodified method.

              You can tell curl to not change the non-GET request method to GET after a 30x response by using the dedicated options for that: --post301, --post302 and -post303.

...Therefore, the note SHOULD contain the information necessary for a user to **repeat the original request on the new URI.**
